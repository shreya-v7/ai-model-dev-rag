  "question": "From S1, S2, S3, S4, which survey most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations? Rank all and justify with evidence.",
  "answer": "S4 most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations, as it provides a comprehensive review of agent benchmarking trends, focusing on realistic and challenging evaluations, which likely aligns with the detailed methodologies and evaluation criteria expected in P1-P10. Ranking of surveys based on available context (assuming S1-S3 are not detailed in provided chunks):\n1. S4 - It discusses current trends in agent benchmarking, emphasizing realistic and challenging evaluations (e.g., SWE-bench for software engineering with real-world GitHub issues) and live benchmarks that adapt to rapid LLM development. This suggests a focus on methods and evaluation practices that are likely relevant to P1-P10.\n2. S1, S2, S3 - Insufficient information is provided in the retrieved contexts to evaluate or rank these surveys relative to P1-P10, as they are not mentioned or detailed in the provided text.",
  "references": [],
  "uncertainty": "Insufficient verifiable quotes in retrieved chunks. Please refine the question."
