# Taxonomy Bonus Draft

Root: Research Agents for Scientific Discovery [P1, P2]

## Training Paradigm
- Prompt-driven Agents: Tool-augmented prompting and planning [P5, P6]
- Specialized Scientific Pretraining: Domain-focused tokenization and corpora [P9]

## Knowledge Access Strategy
- Retrieval-Augmented Workflows: Dynamic grounding against evidence corpora [P4, P10]
- Tool-Centric Execution: External calculators/simulators/APIs [P3, P7]

## Autonomy and Evaluation
- Open-ended Research Benchmarks: Long-horizon task suites [P8]
- Robustness and Reliability: Error handling, uncertainty, and calibration [P1, P2]

## Human-AI Collaboration
- Human-in-the-loop Steering: Review and intervention loops [P6]
- Scientific Writing and Synthesis: Structured claim-evidence reporting [P10]
