  "question": "From S1, S2, S3, S4, which survey most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations? Rank all and justify with evidence.",
  "answer": "S4 most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations, as it provides a comprehensive review of agent benchmarking trends, focusing on realistic and challenging evaluations, live benchmarks, and diverse capabilities which align with potential topics in P1-P10. Ranking: 1. S4 (most relevant due to detailed discussion on agent evaluation trends and benchmarks like SWE-bench and GAIA); 2-4. S1, S2, S3 (not mentioned in the provided contexts, hence no evidence to evaluate their relevance). Justification: S4 discusses current trends in agent benchmarking, including realistic evaluation environments and increasing task complexity, which likely align with the methods and evaluation criteria in P1-P10. Limitations are indirectly addressed through the mention of low performance scores and the need for continuous updates in benchmarks.",
