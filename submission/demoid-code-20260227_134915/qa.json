  "question": "From S1, S2, S3, S4, which survey most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations? Rank all and justify with evidence.",
  "answer": "S4 most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations, as it provides a comprehensive review of agent benchmarking trends, focusing on realistic and challenging evaluations, live benchmarks, and diverse capabilities which likely align with the broad scope of P1-P10. Ranking: 1) S4 - due to its detailed discussion on realistic evaluation environments (e.g., SWE-bench, WebArena) and trends in benchmark complexity; 2) S1, S2, S3 - insufficient information to rank or assess relevance as they are not mentioned in the provided contexts. Justification for S4 is based on its emphasis on real-world complexities, task difficulty, and adaptive methodologies which are likely relevant to a wide range of agent evaluation topics covered in P1-P10.",
