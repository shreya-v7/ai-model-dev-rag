  "question": "From S1, S2, S3, S4, which survey most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations? Rank all and justify with evidence.",
  "answer": "S4 most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations, as it provides a comprehensive review of agent benchmarking trends, focusing on realistic and challenging evaluations, which likely aligns with the detailed methodologies and evaluation criteria expected in P1-P10. Ranking: 1) S4 - due to its detailed discussion on realistic benchmarks like SWE-bench and GAIA, emphasizing real-world complexities and task difficulty; 2-4) S1, S2, S3 - not mentioned in the provided contexts, thus cannot be evaluated or ranked. Justification for S4 is based on its focus on evolving evaluation methodologies towards realism and complexity, which are critical aspects likely covered in P1-P10.",
