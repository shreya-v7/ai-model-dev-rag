  "question": "From S1, S2, S3, S4, which survey most accurately matches P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations? Rank all and justify with evidence.",
  "answer": "S2 is the only survey among S1, S2, S3, and S4 mentioned in the provided contexts that can be evaluated for matching P1-P10 on methods, evaluation, and limitations. S2 focuses on scientific large language models (LLMs) in biological and chemical domains, with detailed evaluation frameworks based on Bloom\u2019s taxonomy and SciEval dimensions (basic knowledge, knowledge application, scientific calculation, and research ability), and categorizes capabilities into Pre-college, College, and Post-college levels. It also includes specific datasets and benchmarks like SciAssess, SciKnowEval, and others for assessing LLMs in scientific contexts. However, direct comparison to P1-P10 is not possible due to limited information on P1-P10\u2019s specific methods, evaluation criteria, and limitations in the provided contexts. S1, S3, and S4 are not described in the retrieved contexts, so they cannot be ranked or evaluated. Ranking: 1. S2 (partially relevant but insufficient for full matching); 2-4. S1, S3, S4 (no data available).",

More recently, SciEval [309] has suggested assessing scientific LLMs across four dimensions: basic knowledge, knowledge application, scientific calculation, and research ability."

  "uncertainty": "The provided contexts do not include information on S1, S3, or S4, nor do they provide specific details on P1-P10\u2019s methods, evaluation, and limitations. Therefore, a complete ranking and matching analysis is not possible. The evaluation of S2 is based on available data, but its alignment with P1-P10 remains speculative without further context on P1-P10."
